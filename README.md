# r20a
A browser extension for Roll20 tweaks

Currently has one feature, a custom menu for editing token markers.
 - Add/remove a marker to multiple tokens
 - Add whatever messages you want to token markers, rather than just 0-9

This is mostly an extension for me and my friends, but feel free to use or modify it.
